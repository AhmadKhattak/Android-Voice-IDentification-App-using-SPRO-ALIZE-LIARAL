****************
Modifications:
****************

There were two main modifications to SPRO:
#define MY_REALLOC(X,Y)  (((X)==NULL)? memset(malloc((Y)),0,(Y)):realloc((X),(Y)))
#define MY_FREE(X) free((X)),(X)=NULL;

All realloc calls in fft.c and spro.c we replaced by MY_REALLOC and all free calls were replaced by MY_FREE call.




The following lines were modified in RecorderActivity code.google.com:
1-	private static final int RECORDER_SAMPLERATE = 8000;// 16000;
2-	private static final int RECORDER_CHANNELS = AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_MONO; //STEREO;


The package has the files required to reproduce the results reported in paper to be published in
